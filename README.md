## Day_1
- **Topic :- Time & Space Complexity**

**What is Time complexity?**
Time complexity means the total amount of time taken by an algorithm to run based on the length of the input.

**What is Space Complexity?**
When an algorithm is run on a computer, it requires a certain amount of memory space. So, The amount of memory used by a program to execute it is known as space complexity.

**Asymptotic notations are classified into three types:**
1) Big-O Notation (Ο) – Big O notation specifically describes worst case scenario & t represents the upper bound running time complexity of an algorithm.

2) Omega Notation (Ω) – Omega(Ω) notation specifically describes best case scenario.

3) Theta Notation (θ) – This notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm.

**Three types of analysis that we perform on a particular algorithm**
1) Best Case: The performance of an algorithm for the input, for which the algorithm takes less time or space.

2) Worst Case: The performance of an algorithm for the input, for which the algorithm takes long time or space.

3) Average Case: The performance of an algorithm for the input, for which the algorithm takes time or space that lies between best and worst case.
  
  
  
  
  
## Day_2
- **Topic :- Array**

**What is Array?**
Array is a collection of similar data items stored at contiguous memory locations and  those elements can be accessed randomly using indices of an array. 

Q1) Reverse the array
